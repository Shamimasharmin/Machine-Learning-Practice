# What is Machine Learning (ML) ?

Answer : Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that anyone provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn or calculate automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

ðŸ‘‰ Anomaly Detection

ðŸ‘‰ Visualization

ðŸ‘‰ Decision Making

Three important libraries for Machine Learning those are use often. They are:
 
                              i) Numpy - import numpy as np
                             ii) Pandas - import pandas as pd
                            iii) matplotlib.pyplot - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                            
                              
# What is Regression ?

Answer : In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables.  

# Types of Regression:

  i) Linear Regression
  
 ii) Multiple Linear Regression
 
iii) Polynomial Regression

 iv) Decision Tree Regression
 
  v) Random Forest Regression
  
  
# What is Linear Regression ?
  
Answer : Linear Regression is the statistical model used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables by examining two factors.The first one is which variables, in particular, are significant predictors of the outcome variable and the second one is how significant is the regression line to make predictions with the highest possible accuracy. 

Linear Regression Formula: Linear regression is a linear approach for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable y and an independent variable x.
 
                                              y = a0 + a1 * x

a0, a1 are co-efficients

Linear regression is also called as Simple Linear Regression. In linear Regression, there will be always one Independent variable (x) .

# What is Multiple Linear Regression ?

Answer : It is a statistical technique used to predict the outcome of a response variable through several explanatory variables and model the relationships between them. It represents line fitment between multiple inputs and one output. 

Multiple Linear Regression Formula : The multiple linear regression explains the relationship between one continuous dependent variable (y) and two or more independent variables (x1, x2, x3..... etc).

                               y = a0 + a1 * x1 + a2 *x2 + a3 * x3 + ...... + a_n * x_n

a0, a1, a2, a3 , ....... , a_n are co-efficients

Multiple Linear regression is also called as Simple Linear Regression but with more relationships. In Multiple Linear Regression, there will be always multiple Independent variables (x1, x2, x3, ..... , x_n) .
